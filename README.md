# simple PHP version switching

**php-version** exposes a `php-version` command allowing developers to switch between versions of PHP.

![](http://i.cloudup.com/Rl7FXze6ra.png)


## This _IS_ for you if

-   You are not satisifed with heavy handed *AMP or PPA-based installers.
-   You [use multiple][homebrew-php] [versions][php-build] of PHP on Linux or Mac.
-   You download [pre-compiled PHP binaries for Windows][windows-bin].
-   You want to run your automated tests against multiple PHP versions.
-   You are a developer that works on a variety of PHP projects each requiring different versions of PHP.
-   You want to work on the latest PHP, but expect to support prior work that was done on older PHP versions.


## This is _NOT_ for you if

-   You are content with heavy handed *AMP installers.
-   You are provisioning a production server so you only need a single PHP install.
-   You **NEVER** work on more than one PHP project at a time.
-   You don't plan on supporting prior work that was done on other PHP versions.
-   You run fish, or another shell that's not bash-script compliant


## Rationale

**php-version** attempts to stick to the classic UNIX notion that tools should do one thing well.

>   While there are [smart](https://github.com/c9s/phpbrew) [alternative](https://github.com/CHH/phpenv)
>   [tools](http://sourceforge.net/p/phpfarm/wiki/Home/) that attempt to [solve](https://github.com/convissor/php_version_solution)
>   this problem, [none](http://www.gnu.org/s/stow/) of the tools I've found were simple enough for me.


## Features

-   [Homebrew installed PHP versions][homebrew-php] are picked up automatically.
-   PHP versions installed [into `~/.phps`][build-php-vers] are picked up automatically.
-   PHP versions listed in the `$PHP_VERSIONS` shell variable are picked up automatically.
-   **snap versioning**: Use a partial version number (i.e. `php-version 5`) to automatically use the latest 5.x version.
-   **per version `php.ini`**: we `export PHPRC` if a version-specific `php.ini` exists.
-   **configurable**: `php-version --help` for details.
-   **bash and zsh** actively supported; though care has been taken such that other shells _may_ work as well (but only [bash] and [zsh] are supported).
-   **tiny**: less than 150 LOC; a single function sourced via your shell's rc file.


## Non-Features

-   no [shims][], sub-shells, symlinks or `cd` [hooks][].
-   we won't leave files and symlinks all over the place.
-   does not attempt to manage Apache, MySQL, etc.
-   does not attempt to compile, build, or install PHP.
-   does not attempt to support OS package manager installed (i.e. ppa, etc.) PHP versions.


## Usage Examples

### Switch to a specific PHP version

    % php-version <version>

### List installed and active (*) PHP version(s)

    % php-version
      5.3.9
      5.3.10
      5.4.0RC8
      5.4.0RC6
      5.4.0
    * 5.4.8


## Install

**[homebrew](http://brew.sh/)** (recommended for OSX users)

    % brew tap homebrew/homebrew-php
    % brew install php-version

**cURL** (for non-OSX users or those that prefer not to use `homebrew`):

    % mkdir -p $HOME/local/php-version # or your place of choice
    % cd !$
    % curl -# -L https://github.com/wilmoore/php-version/tarball/master | tar -xz --strip 1

[Alternative (i.e. non-Homebrew) installation methods][opt-install] are documented on the wiki.


## Setup

> Add one of the following to `$HOME/.bashrc`, `$HOME/.zshrc`, or your shell's equivalent configuration file:

    # Homebrew (recommended)
    source $(brew --prefix php-version)/php-version.sh && php-version 5

    # non-Homebrew
    source $HOME/local/php-version/php-version.sh && php-version 5

Type `php-version --help` for more configuration options such as how to add extra PHP installation paths or `php-config --version` to find out which `php` version is active.

> If you have PHP versions in multiple directories, you can list them in the environment variable `PHP_VERSIONS` separated by spaces as depicted below:

    export PHP_VERSIONS="$HOME/local/php $HOME/php/versions"

**NOTE**: do this before you source `php-version.sh`:

## Deactivate / Uninstall

1. Remove [setup](https://github.com/wilmoore/php-version#setup) configuration.

2. Enter one of the following commands listed below to remove associated files.

        # Homebrew (recommended)
        % brew remove --force php-version

        # non-Homebrew
        % rm -rf $HOME/local/php-version


## Having Issues?

1. Copy the bug report output to your clipboard (`pbcopy` works on Mac OSX; use your OS equivalent)

        % cd /tmp
        % git clone https://github.com/wilmoore/php-version.git
        % source php-version/bug-report.sh | pbcopy

2. File an [issue](https://github.com/wilmoore/php-version/issues?state=open).
